<h1>Practicing Administrative Roles and Actions within Office 365</h1>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
This project involves the installation of the Microsoft Office 365 Developer Program, which gives the user administrative access to Office 365 for 90 days. After installing Office 365 Developer, the user will have administrative control over 16 fictitious users in a workplace scenario. Accessing the administrative section of Office 365 will show us how to reset passwords, block sign-ins, create and delete users, share mailboxes, add groups, trace messages through Exchange, and restore deleted emails via Sharepoint. Learning all of the described administrative features is essential, as Office 365 is heavily utilized in many IT environments. The completion of this project should prepare individuals with the basic fundamentals of Office 365. Thus, when faced with Office 365 troubleshooting scenarios, the individual should have some familiarity in using the Office 365 administrative platform.
